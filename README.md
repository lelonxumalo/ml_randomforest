# Random Forest in Jupyter Notebook

The dataset includes characteristics of fruit and the resulting label (fruit name) attached to each instance. For example, each instance (row) in the data table has information about 'height', 'width', 'mass', and 'color'. These features are the explanatory variables while the label (fruit names) are what we are going to try to predict for new instances.
